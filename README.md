8 bit Barrel Shifter using 2x1 which performs arithmetic, logical and circular shifts. A barrel shifter is a Digital circuit that can shift a data word by a specified number of bits in one clock cycle. It can be implemented as a sequence of multipliers (mux), and in such an implementation the output of one mux is connected to the input of the next mux in a way that depends on the shift distance.
